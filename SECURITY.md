# Security Guidelines

## Security Improvements Made

### 1. Environment Variable Validation
- Added validation for required environment variables on startup
- Application exits gracefully if critical variables are missing

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Added comprehensive webhook payload validation
- Implemented input sanitization for AI service inputs
- Added length limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Implemented basic rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Configurable limits (100 requests per 60 seconds by default)

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Structured logging with timestamps and levels
- Specific error messages without exposing sensitive data
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 5. Production Security
- Debug mode disabled by default
- Environment-controlled configuration
- Secure signature verification with timing attack protection

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Replace all sample data in `.env`
   - [ ] Use strong, randomly generated secrets
   - [ ] Ensure `.env` is not committed to version control

2. **Configuration**
   - [ ] Update `USER_MAPPING` with actual GitHub/Slack user mappings
   - [ ] Remove all sample user data
   - [ ] Set `FLASK_DEBUG=False`

3. **Infrastructure**
   - [ ] Use HTTPS in production
   - [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
   - [ ] Configure persistent storage for scheduler jobs
   - [ ] Set up rate limiting at the reverse proxy level

4. **Dependencies**
   - [ ] Run `pip audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - [ ] Keep dependencies updated regularly

### Security Best Practices

1. **Secrets Management**
   ```bash
   # Generate secure webhook secret
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. **API Key Rotation**
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor failed authentication attempts
   - Set up alerts for rate limit violations
   - Log all webhook processing events

4. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all communications
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Consider IP whitelisting for webhooks

## Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Gunicorn + Nginx
```bash
# Install gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run with gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

### Option 3: Cloud Platforms
- **Heroku**: Easy deployment with buildpacks
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Managed platform
- **Google Cloud Run**: Serverless container platform

## Security Monitoring

Set up monitoring for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- API errors and timeouts
- Unusual webhook patterns
